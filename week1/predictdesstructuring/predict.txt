Problem 1: Will console log Tesla and Mercedes

Problem 2:console.log(name) Reference Error as name is not defined console.log(otherName) will console log Elon

Problem 3: console.log(password) will console log "12345" as that variable was declared outside of the person object so its just console logging the declared variable
as such since the variable was declared outside the person it cant be destructured from the person object so the console.log(hashedpassword) will come back undefined

Problem 4 console.log(first==second) console logs false console.log(first==third) console logs true

Problem 5 console.log(key) will console log the word 'value' console.log(secondKey) will console log the second key array
console.log(secondKey[0]) will console log the number 1 as its first in the array at index 0  and console.log(willthiswork) will console log the number 5 as its in the 1 or 2nd index of the array
